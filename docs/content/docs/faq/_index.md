## How do I force a re-ingestion?

The Ingestion Watcher runs as a **CronJob** (default: every 6 hours). It deduplicates files by SHA-256 hash — only new or changed SBOMs are enqueued. There are two scenarios:

### Ingest new/changed files immediately

Trigger the CronJob manually instead of waiting for the next scheduled run:

```bash
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/<RELEASE>-ingestion-watcher manual-ingest-$(date +%s) -n <NAMESPACE>
```

Replace `<RELEASE>` with your Helm release name (e.g. `seebom`) and `<NAMESPACE>` with your namespace.

**Example:**

```bash
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/seebom-ingestion-watcher manual-ingest-$(date +%s) -n seebom
```

This creates a one-off Job from the CronJob spec. The Watcher scans all sources (S3 buckets + local PVC), skips already-processed files, and enqueues anything new.

### Full re-ingestion from scratch

If you need to **reprocess everything** (e.g. after changing the license policy, enabling OSV scanning, or upgrading parsing logic), you must first truncate all data tables and then trigger re-ingestion:

**Step 1 — Truncate all data tables:**

```bash
kubectl exec -n <NAMESPACE> <CLICKHOUSE_POD> -c clickhouse -- \
  clickhouse-client --database=seebom --password="<PASSWORD>" --multiquery \
  --query "TRUNCATE TABLE ingestion_queue; \
           TRUNCATE TABLE license_compliance; \
           TRUNCATE TABLE vulnerabilities; \
           TRUNCATE TABLE sbom_packages; \
           TRUNCATE TABLE sboms; \
           TRUNCATE TABLE vex_statements;"
```

The default ClickHouse pod name follows this pattern:
`chi-<RELEASE>-clickhouse-<CLUSTER_NAME>-0-0-0`

For a typical installation this would be:

```bash
kubectl exec -n seebom chi-seebom-clickhouse-seebom-cluster-0-0-0 -c clickhouse -- \
  clickhouse-client --database=seebom --password="$CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD" --multiquery \
  --query "TRUNCATE TABLE ingestion_queue; \
           TRUNCATE TABLE license_compliance; \
           TRUNCATE TABLE vulnerabilities; \
           TRUNCATE TABLE sbom_packages; \
           TRUNCATE TABLE sboms; \
           TRUNCATE TABLE vex_statements;"
```

**Step 2 — Trigger re-ingestion:**

```bash
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/seebom-ingestion-watcher reingest-$(date +%s) -n seebom
```

**Step 3 — Monitor progress:**

```bash
# Watch the watcher job
kubectl logs -n seebom -l job-name=reingest-<TIMESTAMP> -f

# Watch the parsing workers
kubectl logs -n seebom -l app.kubernetes.io/component=parsing-worker --tail=20 -f

# Check dashboard stats via API
kubectl exec -n seebom deploy/seebom-api-gateway -- \
  wget -qO- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/stats/dashboard | jq '.total_sboms, .total_packages'
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
If you use the **Kind** local development setup, you can use the Makefile shortcut instead:

```bash
make kind-reingest
```

This truncates all tables and triggers re-ingestion in one step.

## When do I need a full re-ingestion?

A full re-ingestion (truncate + re-ingest) is required when:

| Scenario | Why |
|---|---|
| Changed the **license policy** (`license-policy.json`) | Existing packages need reclassification |
| Enabled/disabled **OSV scanning** (`skipOSV`) | Vulnerability data needs to be fetched or cleared |
| Enabled/disabled **GitHub license resolution** (`skipGitHubResolve`) | Unknown licenses need re-resolution |
| Upgraded **parsing logic** (new image version) | Existing SBOMs may parse differently (e.g., new in-toto attestation support or improved license resolution with well-known Go module mappings) |
| Changed **license exceptions** | Exception matching is applied during ingestion |
| Added a **GitHub token** (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) | Previously rate-limited resolution may have missed packages — a re-ingestion with the token resolves all licenses |

For these changes, a simple incremental re-trigger will **not** reprocess existing files because the SHA-256 hashes haven't changed.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
Changes to **VEX files** do **not** require a full re-ingestion. VEX matching is applied at query time. Simply add or update your `.openvex.json` files and trigger an incremental re-ingestion to pick them up.

## How do I check ingestion progress?

```bash
# Job queue status
kubectl exec -n seebom <CLICKHOUSE_POD> -c clickhouse -- \
  clickhouse-client --database=seebom --password="$CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD" \
  --query "SELECT argMax(status, created_at) AS status, count() AS cnt \
           FROM ingestion_queue \
           GROUP BY job_id \
           HAVING status != '' \
           GROUP BY status \
           ORDER BY status" \
  --format=PrettyCompact

# Data summary
kubectl exec -n seebom <CLICKHOUSE_POD> -c clickhouse -- \
  clickhouse-client --database=seebom --password="$CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD" \
  --query "SELECT 'sboms' AS table, count() AS rows FROM sboms FINAL \
           UNION ALL SELECT 'packages', count() FROM sbom_packages FINAL \
           UNION ALL SELECT 'vulns', count() FROM vulnerabilities FINAL \
           UNION ALL SELECT 'licenses', count() FROM license_compliance FINAL" \
  --format=PrettyCompact
```

Or use the API endpoint:

```bash
curl -s http://<API_HOST>/api/v1/stats/dashboard | jq .
```

## How do I clear / reset the database?

### Docker Compose (local development)

The quickest way to start from scratch:

```bash
make dev-reset
```

This stops all containers, deletes the ClickHouse data volume, and restarts everything. All SBOMs will be re-ingested from the `sboms/` directory.

If you only want to wipe specific tables (e.g. vulnerabilities and licenses) without losing SBOM data:

```bash
make ch-shell
```

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE vulnerabilities;
TRUNCATE TABLE license_compliance;
```

Then re-trigger processing:

```bash
make re-scan
```

### Kubernetes

See [Full re-ingestion from scratch](#full-re-ingestion-from-scratch) above — it covers truncating all tables and re-triggering the Ingestion Watcher.

## Should I use a GitHub token?

**Yes — we strongly recommend setting `GITHUB_TOKEN`**, especially when ingesting container-image SBOMs (e.g. those generated by Syft/BuildKit).

### Why?

Many container-image SBOMs contain packages with `NOASSERTION` as the declared license. SeeBOM's parsing worker resolves these by querying the GitHub API. Without a token, GitHub enforces a rate limit of **60 requests per hour** — which is quickly exhausted when processing SBOMs with hundreds of packages.

| | Without token | With token |
|---|---|---|
| Rate limit | 60 req/h | **5,000 req/h** |
| License resolution | Partial (many remain `NOASSERTION`) | Complete |
| Recommended | Only for small test runs | **Always** |

### How to set it up

1. Create a **GitHub Personal Access Token (classic)** at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). **No scopes are required** — the token only needs unauthenticated-level access to public repository metadata.

2. Set the token:

**Docker Compose (`.env`):**

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Kind (local Kubernetes):**

```bash
# local/secrets.env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Kubernetes (Helm values):**

```yaml
github:
  token: "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Or via `--set`:

```bash
helm upgrade seebom deploy/helm/seebom/ --set github.token="ghp_..."
```

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}
If you initially ingested SBOMs **without** a GitHub token, many packages may have unresolved licenses. After adding the token, you need a **full re-ingestion** to resolve them:

```bash
# Docker Compose:
make dev-reset

# Kubernetes:
# See "Full re-ingestion from scratch" above
```

## What example files are included?

The `sboms/` directory ships with several example files for testing and demonstration:

| File | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `_example.spdx.json` | Plain SPDX JSON | A minimal SPDX 2.3 document with packages, licenses, and PURLs. Good starting point for testing the basic pipeline. |
| `_example-intoto.spdx.json` | In-toto attestation envelope | An SPDX document wrapped in an in-toto attestation `predicate` field — the format generated by Syft/BuildKit for container images. Tests the parser's auto-detection and unwrapping. |
| `_example-violations.spdx.json` | Plain SPDX JSON | Contains packages with copyleft licenses (GPL, AGPL) to test license compliance violations and exception handling. |
| `_example.openvex.json` | OpenVEX | A VEX document that suppresses specific CVEs for demonstration. Tests the VEX ingestion and dashboard effective-vulnerability counts. |
| `golang-common.openvex.json` | OpenVEX | Real-world VEX statements for common Go ecosystem false positives. |
| `otel-protobuf.openvex.json` | OpenVEX | VEX statements for OpenTelemetry protobuf-related findings. |
| `license-policy.json` | License Policy | The active license classification policy (permissive vs. copyleft SPDX IDs). Based on the [CNCF Allowed Third-Party License Policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/policies-guidance/allowed-third-party-license-policy.md). |
| `license-exceptions.json` | License Exceptions | Active license exceptions in [CNCF format](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/license-exceptions/exceptions.json). Exempts specific packages from violation reporting. |

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
Files prefixed with `_` are treated as examples and are ignored by the default `SBOM_LIMIT` when set. To test with them, either set `SBOM_LIMIT=0` or place your own `.spdx.json` files in the `sboms/` directory.

## How do I trigger a CVE refresh?

The CVE Refresher runs as a CronJob (default: daily at 2 AM). To trigger it immediately:

```bash
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/seebom-cve-refresher manual-cve-refresh-$(date +%s) -n seebom
```

This checks all known PURLs against the [OSV database](https://osv.dev) for newly disclosed vulnerabilities.

**Docker Compose:**

```bash
make cve-refresh
```
